# Slots Game (PixiJS + TypeScript)

A TypeScript slot machine built on PixiJS with Spine animations, sound, and a small win-detection engine. This README covers how the app works, the types of wins it can detect, what each UI button does, the tech stack, and how to run/debug the project locally (including WebStorm debugger setup).


## Overview
- Rendered with PixiJS 7; animated frame and effects via pixi-spine.
- Core game grid is 4 rows × 6 columns (REEL_COUNT × SYMBOLS_PER_REEL), with symbol size and spacing defined in a central constants class.
- A background image is fitted inside the Spine frame behind the reels (with masking to prevent bleed).
- Sounds (spin loop, win, button) are played via Howler.js.
- Win detection supports three categories: straight lines, diagonals, and adjacency paths.
- Includes unit tests for win logic and SlotMachine life cycle.


## Win types detected
Win detection resides in `src/core/GameCoreLogic.ts`. All wins return paths as arrays of `{ r, c }` coordinates (r = row, c = column) referring to the 4×6 grid.

1) Straight
- Horizontal: all symbols in a given row match.
- Vertical: all symbols in a given column match.
- In code, `findHorizontalWins` and `findVerticalWins` identify these and `computeWins` combines them into the `straight` category.

2) Diagonal
- Lines that run from the top row to the bottom row with a constant column delta of +1 (down-right) or −1 (down-left).
- Found by `findDiagonalWins` and returned under `diagonal`.

3) Adjacency (non‑straight connecting paths)
- Any top-to-bottom path of the same symbol using only the next row and stepping columns by −1, 0, or +1 each step (down-left, down, down-right).
- Implemented via a BFS in `findAdjacencyWins`.
- Paths that are actually straight or perfect diagonals are filtered out so `adjacency` only contains the non‑straight zig‑zag connections.

Helper: `GameCoreLogic.checkWin(grid)` returns both the categorized wins and a combined `allPaths` array.


## UI and buttons
UI is built in `src/ui/UI.ts` and layered above the slot machine.

- Spin button
  - Texture: `button_spin.png`.
  - Has a simple shadow effect that follows hover and press.
  - Click behavior: plays the "Spin button" sound, briefly scales down (with shadow), triggers `SlotMachine.spin()`.
  - While spinning: the button is disabled and a spin sound loops; it is re-enabled when spinning finishes.

- Win: Straight (LR/TB)
  - Triggers `SlotMachine.forceStraightWinInAnyColumn()`.
  - Forces a winnable grid for either a horizontal (left-to-right) or vertical (top-to-bottom) straight line on the next spin (toggles orientation internally between spins).

- Win: Diagonal
  - Triggers `SlotMachine.forceRandomDiagonalWin()`.
  - Forces a diagonal win (+1 or −1 slope) for the next spin.

- Win: Any Line
  - Triggers `SlotMachine.forceRandomStraightConnectingLineWin()`.
  - Forces a connecting path (adjacency-style top-to-bottom path) on the next spin.


## Technologies and libraries
- TypeScript 5
- PixiJS 7 (`pixi.js`): 2D rendering
- pixi-spine: Spine runtime to render the frame/effects animations
- Howler.js: audio playback (`src/utils/Sound.ts` wrapper)
- Webpack 5 + webpack-dev-server: build and serve (dev)
- Jest + ts-jest: unit testing
- ESLint + @typescript-eslint: linting


## Source highlights
- `src/consts/GameConstants.ts` — central constants (REEL_COUNT = 4, SYMBOLS_PER_REEL = 6, SYMBOL_SIZE = 150, REEL_HEIGHT = SYMBOL_SIZE, REEL_SPACING = 10).
- `src/Game.ts` — initializes Pixi application, loads assets, adds `SlotMachine` and `UI`, handles window resize.
- `src/utils/AssetLoader.ts` — packages and loads images/spines/sounds via Pixi Assets, exposes `getTexture`/`getSpine`.
- `src/utils/Sound.ts` — small Howler registry with safe play/stop/loop operations.
- `src/slots/SlotMachine.ts` — core reels view, background fitted into Spine frame, spin lifecycle, win-path drawing, and force-win helpers.
- `src/core/GameCoreLogic.ts` — win detection (straight, diagonal, adjacency) and aggregator.
- `tests/*.test.ts` — unit tests for game logic and SlotMachine.

Assets (copied to `dist/assets` during build):
- Images: `src/assets/images/`
- Spines: `src/assets/spines/`
- Sounds: `src/assets/sounds/`

**WARNING:**  
**You must run the build process before running the project to ensure all assets are properly generated and available. The asset manifest and related files are generated during the build, and failing to build will cause asset loading errors.**

## Getting started
Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (recommended) and npm.

Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

Start the dev server
```
npm start
```
By default, webpack-dev-server serves on http://localhost:9000 (see `webpack.config.js`).

Build a production bundle
```
npm run build
```
The bundle is output to `dist/`.

Run tests
```
npm test
```
Optionally watch:
```
npm run test:watch
```


## Running the app locally
1) `npm install`
2) `npm start`
3) Open your browser at http://localhost:9000
4) You should see the slot machine with the base feature frame, background, and UI buttons.

If assets don’t appear, ensure the `src/assets` folder is present (webpack copies it to `dist/assets`). Check DevTools console for 404s.


## Debugging with WebStorm
Webpack is configured with `devtool: 'inline-source-map'`, so TypeScript sources are mapped in the browser.

1) In WebStorm, create a new Run/Debug Configuration:
   - Type: JavaScript Debug
   - URL: `http://localhost:9000`
   - Browser: Chrome (or your preferred Chromium-based browser)
2) Start the dev server: `npm start` (or use a dedicated NPM run configuration in WebStorm).
3) Click Debug on the JavaScript Debug configuration. WebStorm will open the URL and attach the debugger.
4) Set breakpoints directly in your `.ts` files (e.g., `src/slots/SlotMachine.ts`, `src/core/GameCoreLogic.ts`). They should bind thanks to source maps.

Tip: You can also start `npm start` from a WebStorm NPM configuration and check the "Before launch" steps to ensure the dev server starts before attaching.

## Troubleshooting
- Port already in use: change `devServer.port` in `webpack.config.js` or stop the process using 9000.
- Assets 404 in the browser: ensure `src/assets` exists and webpack copy plugin maps `src/assets/**` to `dist/assets/**`.
- Breakpoints not hitting: confirm source maps are enabled (`devtool: 'inline-source-map'`) and that you’re debugging the correct URL. Try clearing cache/hard refresh.
- Jest tests cannot find non-code assets: Jest maps image/sound files to a stub via `jest.config.ts` (`tests/stubs/fileStub.js`).
